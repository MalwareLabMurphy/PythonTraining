# PythonTraining
I've always enjoyed learning/playing with the Python coding language as part of my professional development, but sadly I have yet to hold a role that requires with me to work with it enough to stay fresh and remember everything I've learned. Thus, I find myself taking some sort of introductory/intermediate Python training about once a year in hopes something will stick.
Devoting this repository to any projects/exercises that come of my annual Python reminder training in case there's value for any of the code in future efforts.
