# PythonTraining
<p>I've always enjoyed learning/playing with the Python coding language as part of my professional development, but sadly I have yet to hold a role that requires with me to work with it enough to stay fresh and remember everything I've learned. Thus, I find myself taking some sort of introductory/intermediate Python training about once a year in hopes something will stick.</p>
<p>Devoting this repository to any projects/exercises that come of my annual Python reminder training in case there's value for any of the code in future efforts.</p>
<p>In lieu of trying to learn the language from my own practice and chicken-scratch, here are a few of the resources that I've found particularly useful:</p>

- [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/) - I mean,  you have to start somewhere...
- [Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/) - Maybe not the same experience as your typical desktop coding environment, but allows you to practice and learn pretty much anywhere, even at the free tier.
- [Udemy: The Complete Business Intelligence Analyst Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-business-intelligence-analyst-course-2018/) - I took the 2021 version of this training and it was a trememdous refresher on basic statistical concepts, as well as a great introduction to many of the tools and programming languages that are utilized in business intelligence.
- [Udemy: Python 101: From N00B to N3RD](https://www.udemy.com/course/total-introduction-to-python/) - Another Udemy course I came across that had a good mix of introductory lessons, as well as more advanced lessons involving data processing/analysis with Pandas.
- [TCM Security: Practical Ethical Hacking](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-ethical-hacking-the-complete-course) - Although security-focused, has a fairly comprehensive portion devoted to Python fundamentals, as well as exercises in developing security tools with the language.
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) - I feel like this website will catch on one of these days...
